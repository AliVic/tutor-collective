## Introduction

Tutor Collective is a collaborative project to build the world's best way to find great tutors. The project is sponsored by TechCareerHQ and is intended to enable people to learn web development by being a part of the building a great product. You don't need any prior programming experience to contribute, just a willingness to find the best solution to the problems that you encounter. Please follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

You need the following:
* Ruby 1.9.3
* GitHub account / git

For a quick install of a development setup we recommend [BitNami](http://bitnami.com/stack/ruby/installer). But, we have also attached manual instructions [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/techcareerhq/tutor-collective/blob/master/Setup%20Instructions.md). If you need additional help please feel free to contact us at my@techcareerhq.com and we will help you get set up.

###Design Guidelines
The color palette for the overall site is available here: http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3087487/BlueC 
We'll try to use these colors whenver possible. For calls to action or other elements that require a color outside of the palette, we'll defer to [Boostrap's default button styles](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html#buttons)
